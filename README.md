Credit goes to Butterscotch! for making this work, I just made an installer.

1. Enable developer mode on your phone/tablet.
    Open settings, find the build number, tap it 7 times.

2. Download Termux from here: https://github.com/ender-music/slimevr-termux-installer

3. Open Termux, and run the following command.
```
wget https://github.com/ender-music/slimevr-termux-installer/releases/download/v0.1/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
